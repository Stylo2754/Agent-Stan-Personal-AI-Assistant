### 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

High-functioning individuals and teams rely on executive assistants to manage the high volume of communications and scheduling requests they face daily. Commercial software solutions that attempt to automate these tasks are often expensive, with typical costs exceeding $30/month, and lack the flexibility for deep personalization.

Agent Stan addresses this gap by providing a powerful, self-hosted AI executive assistant that offers the functionality of a premium service at a fraction of the costâ€”approximately $1 per 1,000 processed emails. This project provides a blueprint for a highly efficient and customizable productivity system.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** To develop an AI agent that can reliably automate email and calendar management based on natural language commands.
* **Performance Objective:** Ensure that user requests are processed and a draft action is generated in under 3 seconds.
* **Functional Objective:** The agent must support complex, multi-step tasks, such as composing an email and generating a calendar invite from a single command.
* **Financial Objective:** Reduce the cost of productivity automation by over 90% compared to subscription-based commercial alternatives.

### 3. Key Features & Functional Requirements

| ID  | Feature                       | User Story                                                                                                          | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 1   | **Unified Communications** | As a user, I want to manage communications for both my work and personal accounts from a single chat interface.        | - The agent can send and reply to emails using distinct Google Account credentials.<br>- The agent can query multiple Google Calendars to get a comprehensive view of availability.                            |
| 2   | **Compound Task Execution** | As a user, I want to draft an email and simultaneously send my availability with a calendar invite in one command.     | - The agent must parse the user's intent to identify multiple distinct actions (e.g., email + calendar).<br>- The agent executes the "Check Availability" and "Create Gcal Invite" sub-workflows in parallel with email drafting. |
| 3   | **High-Speed Response** | As a user, I want the agent to respond to my commands near-instantly so my workflow is not interrupted.                | - The time from receiving a user prompt to presenting a drafted action for approval must be ~2.5 seconds.<br>- The time from approval to final execution must be ~2.5 seconds.                              |
| 4   | **Human-in-the-Loop Control** | As a user, I want to review and approve all actions before they are executed to prevent errors.                       | - Every action that modifies an external state (sending an email, creating an event) must generate an approval message.<br>- The action is only executed if the user explicitly clicks "Approve."             |
| 5   | **Voice-Activated Commands** | As a user, I want to issue commands via voice notes while on the go for maximum efficiency.                         | - The agent's trigger correctly handles incoming audio files from Telegram.<br>- The audio is successfully transcribed to text and used as the input prompt for the Langchain agent.                          |

### 4. Technical Architecture

* **Frontend Interface:** Telegram
* **Backend Orchestration:** Visual Workflow Automation Engine
* **Core Intelligence:** Langchain Agent Framework (with OpenAI GPT-4)
* **APIs & Services:** Google Gmail API, Google Calendar API, OpenAI API (Whisper), Telegram Bot API
